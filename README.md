### How can I create my own OS?
One of the main GitHub repositories that helped me quite a lot is the [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/) one, made by [cfenollosa](https://github.com/cfenollosa). It quite briefly explains what each commands are, in Assembly and how to use them; I also recommend learning the basics of Assembly.
