# What's Coming Soon?

Hopefully, if possible, with the help of other developers; we can successfully add a proper file system and an upgraded kernel where you can play audio and use the microphone (which might not happen on **all** boots because if you are trying to dual-boot into it, because some operating systems [mainly some Linux distros] have unfunctional audio input/output kernels which may enhance difficulty into doing so).

Once the file system has been added, maybe a XFCE desktop environment will be added onto `drippleMini Desktop`.
